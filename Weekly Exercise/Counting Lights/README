Weekly Assignment: Counting lights

Included Files:
	* counting.cpp
	* MAKEFILE
	* README

Accessories:
	* Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
	* 330 Ohm resistor
	* LED
	* Push button
	* Wires

Wiring instructions: 
	* Arduino 5V <--> Breadboard 5V
	* Arduino GNU <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin 13 <--> Longer LED lead |LED| shorted LED lead <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin 12 <--> Longer LED lead |LED| shorted LED lead <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin 11 <--> Longer LED lead |LED| shorted LED lead <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin 10 <--> Longer LED lead |LED| shorted LED lead <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin  9 <--> Longer LED lead |LED| shorted LED lead <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin  7 <--> push button lead |Push Button| push push button lead <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin  6 <--> push button lead |Push Button| push push button lead <--> Breadboard GNU
	* Ardiuno Pin  5 <--> push button lead |Push Button| push push button lead <--> Breadboard GNU

Running instructions:
	1. Connect the Ardiuno to PC using an USB. Make sure that the Ardunio is using the proper serial
	port (/dev/ttuACMO or -ACM1)

	2. In the directory containing the files counting.cpp and makefile, use the command "make upload && serial-mon" to upload the code to the Arduino

General overiew:
	The purpose of the program is to enable the user to use the push buttons to light up the LEDs. Each push button has its own purpose:
		increment button: projects an increasing sequence of binary bits through the 5 leds.
		decrement button: projects an decreasing sequence of binary bits through the 5 leds.
		memory button: stores the current state of the LEDs and if pressed again, it recovers the stored state and displays it.

Assumptions:
	- Pressing the push button too fast may cause unexpected results.
